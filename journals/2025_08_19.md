- [[Java]] for small coding task course
- Learned about microservice TLS and [[JWT]] security.
	- [[TLS]] is used for ssl handshake , in java truststore is mostly used for it.
		- if we have two application on different host , Host A --> HOST B , then for host a to make rest call with host b , host b must trust host a , so in truststore of host b there must be the certificate of host A
- TODO JWT and security concepts revise
