  >If you're talking about machine learning in particular, there are two stages: `training and inference`.
	- ==**Training**== is when you **feed data to a neural network and get it to build a model** of the world. You could be training a very specific model like a ==classifier that learns to categorize objects==, or you could be training something really general-purpose like an LLM.
		- Doing that training requires massive amounts of calculations, and whether you're doing it on your own computer or a cluster of thousands of GPUs, you need very sophisticated software to feed the training data as efficiently as possible through the training algorithms. And the reality is that all of the best software is all built around Python.
	- Could it be done in another language like Java? Of course. But ==you'd be throwing away so much if you did that==. All of the amazing tools built by an ecosystem of tens of thousands of the best machine learning practitioners in the world, ==all centered around Python== and Python-based tools like Jupyter notebooks.
	- The other half of machine learning is **==inference==** - where you **take a trained model and use it to classify, to generate images, to generate text**, etc. - there's no reason that needs to be done in Python, and in fact it's quite common to embed it in software written in all sorts of languages. **So for that part, by all means use Java**.
